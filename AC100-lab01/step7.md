In this step, you will verify that the Cassandra node has been upgraded and that the data is still available.

Verify that the version is 4.0.0
```
nodetool version
```{{execute T1}}

Open a cql shell.
```
cqlsh
```{{execute T1}}

Use the keyspace.
```
USE united_states;
```{{execute T1}}

Verify that the data has been loaded.
```
SELECT * FROM cities_by_state;
```{{execute T1}}
