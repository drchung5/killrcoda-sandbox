In this scenario you will learn how to upgrade an Apache Cassandraâ„¢ cluster from 3.x to 4.x. To keep the scenario from becoming too complex, in the hands on exercises of this senario you will perform a migration of a *single-node* cluster. 

Production Cassandra clusters always have multiple nodes. Therefore, steps have notes describing the *extra* work necessary to upgrade *multi-node* clusters.

In this scenarion, you will:
- Configure a single node Cassandra 3.x cluster
- Populate this cluster with data
- Prepare the cluster for upgrade
- Install Cassandra 4.x
- Start Cassandra 4.x cluster
- Verify that the data has upgraded to the Cassandra 4.x cluster
